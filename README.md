# Turing-Machine-Builder-in-Java (Transducer Machines)
<br />Transducer Turing Machines a type of Turing Machines which do not consist the set of Final states and hence are a 6-tuple machine. Hence They just operate onto the input on the tape to give out necessary output string. One of the examples is a Turing Machine to obtain 2's complement of the given binary number.
<br />For the above program, the input is given as a path to the input txt-file which consists of details such as symbols used, number of states and transitions for each state.
<br />Two such input files (unary_multiply, copy_string) are given as examples for the structure of input file.
